# Final Project CSCI 4100U

## Overview
The final project for CSCI 4100U requires you to create a smart phone app using Flutter. The final project has two components:
* Project Proposal
* Project Development

All of the groups have alread submitted their project proposals so you should be in the phase of development now. Please note that your project should adhere to the requirements you have committed in your project proposal. You are free to add extra features but missing a requirement might result in loss of marks.

## Instructions
You are required to work on this project in groups of 5 people or less. Make sure there is a focal person (Team Lead) in the group who will be responsible for managing the project along with contributing towards his/her part in the project. 

Team Lead would be responsible for submission of the project as well. Please note that only Team Lead will submit the final project (not every member of the group is required to make submission of the project). 

### Submission
Team Lead is expected to make the submission of the final project through Github, exactly how you have been submitting your labs.  Please make sure to take appropriate screenshots of all the screens and actions you deem necessary and place them in a separate folder inside your project. You can call this folder `Screenshots`. The deadline for submission of the project is **December 5, 2021**.

### Presentations
Each group is expected to present their final project based on the schedule provided below. Max. alloted time for each group presentation is **30 minutes**. Each group would designate a team member who would share the screen and help navigate throughout the presentation (other members should avoid sharing their screens on their turn of presentation to avoid waste of time). Team Lead is expected to start the presentation by introducing the group members and a brief introduction of 1-2 mins of the project and then handing over the mic to the next person in the queue for presentation. Make sure your mics are working fine. Failure to attend the presentation would result in loss of marks.

*Note: No powerpoint slides are required for the presentation.*

### Presentation Schedule
Please join the virtual class link on Google meet on the day of the presentation. Make sure to join at least 5 minutes before your time slot to avoid unnecessary delays.
